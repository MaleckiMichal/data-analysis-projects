# Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains various data analysis projects, each focusing on different datasets, techniques, and methodologies. The projects primarily involve data cleaning, organization, visualization, and facilitating the process of deriving insights from the data.

## Repository Structure

Each project is organized in a separate folder. The folder names follow a numerical prefix format, where:

- `001_First_Project/` represents the first project,
- `002_Second_Project/` represents the second project,
- and so on.

### Example Structure
